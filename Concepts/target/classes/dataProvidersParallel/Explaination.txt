1. In Parallel data-providers each data from data-providers require separate browsers to execute
2. Therefore launch browser code should be written inside @BeforeMethod. 
3. We get exception if launch code is written in @BeforeClass
4. To achieve parallel Data-providers we should pass attribute "parallel=true" to data-provider @Dataprovider annotation
   Ex: @Dataprovider(parallel=true)
5. We need to add parallel="methods" attribute for <test> tag in testNg.xml
   Ex: <test thread-count="5" name="Test" parallel="methods">
   NOTE: If we only add parallel="methods" in <test> tag, it will open 1 browser for each data from Data-provider
		  i.e. if the data provider is providing 100 data from excel file and then it will open 100 browsers at a shot
		  which will lead to system or browser crash. To avoid thi we need to go for step 6.
		  
6. To control the maximum number of browser to be opened at a time, we need to add "data-provider-thread-count="3"" in <suite> tag
   Ex: <suite name="Suite" data-provider-thread-count="3">
   The above code will open only 3 browsers for 1st 3 sets of data and goes no. But it will not open 100 browsers for all
   100 data of excel
