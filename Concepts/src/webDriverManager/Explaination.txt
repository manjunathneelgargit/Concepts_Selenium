Why WebDriverManager?
	Every time it will use the same browser driver if we use System.setProperty() to setup browser specific paths
	It will cause a problem when you are running scripts on different OS or different browser versions
	To avoid this problem we will go for WebDriverManager
	
	Also some below listed common problems
	Script worked properly yesterday but not today
	Script working in my machine not in colleague/Clientâ€™s machine to avoid these problems we will go for WebDriverManager

	
	
Usage in code
1. Add Maven dependency
2. Create a class WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup(); //For setting up chrome browser


NOTE:
WebDriverManager will create a one properties file to handle driver exe updates and all and is located in
C:\Users\Manjunath\.cache\selenium\resolution.properties
