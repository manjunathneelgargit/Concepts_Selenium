The main points we are covering is
1. Earlier we used to configure extent report config method or db connection methods in @Before suite
   and we used to add @Listeners annotation in every script file we write which was resulting in 
   tightely coupling of code. We should not do that.
   The solution for the above problem is to achieve that by Listeners
   
 Steps to overcome above problem
 1. Create a class and that class should implement ITestListener and ISuiteListener classes
 2. Provide implementation for all the methods.
 	i. You can now provide extent report config method or db connection methods in onStart()
 3. Add the following code in testng.xml between <suite> and <test>
 	<listeners>
		<listener class-name="listeners_2_advanced.ListenerImp" />
	</listeners>
